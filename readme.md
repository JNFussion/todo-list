This project is from [The odin project's JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list).

This page consist is in a todo list app. You can create projects which have a set of tasks. These tasks have a priority: low, medium or hight. Task as well as well as projects can have a description and a due date. The priority of a project is set in function of the amount of task, the priority of the majority of tasks will decide the priority of the project.<br>
Tasks of a project can be sort by the date of creation, priority or due date.

All projects can be found in home. All tasks can be grouped by today (tasks with due date on today), upcoming (due date from tomorrow to a weak) and priority.
